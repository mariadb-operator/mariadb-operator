# Backup and Restore

> [!NOTE]  
> This documentation applies to `mariadb-operator` version >= v0.0.28

`mariadb-operator` allows you to declarativaly take backups by defining `Backup` resources and later on restore them by using their `Restore` counterpart. These resources get reconciled into `Job`/`CronJob` resources that automatically perform the backup/restore operations, so you don't need to manually script them.

## Storage types

Currently, the following storage types are supported:
- **[S3](../examples/manifests/backup_s3.yaml) compatible storage**: Store backups in a S3 compatible storage, such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio). 
- **[PVCs](../examples/manifests/backup.yaml)**: Use the available [StorageClasses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) in your Kubernetes cluster to provision a PVC dedicated to store the backup files.
- **[Kubernetes volumes](../examples/manifests/backup_nfs.yaml)**: Use any of the [volume types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#volume-types) supported natively by Kubernetes.

Our recommendation is to store the backups externally in a [S3](../examples/manifests/backup.yaml) compatible storage. [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio) makes this incredibly easy, take a look at our [Minio reference installation](#minio-reference-installation) to quickly spin up an instance.

## `Backup` CR

You can take a one-time backup of your `MariaDB` instance by declaring the following resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  storage:
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 100Mi
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
```
This will use the default `StorageClass` to provision a PVC that would hold the backup files, but ideally you should use a S3 compatible storage:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  storage:
    s3:
      bucket: backups
      prefix: mariadb
      endpoint: minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000
      region:  us-east-1
      accessKeyIdSecretKeyRef:
        name: minio
        key: access-key-id
      secretAccessKeySecretKeyRef:
        name: minio
        key: secret-access-key
      tls:
        enabled: true
        caSecretKeyRef:
          name: minio-ca
          key: ca.crt
```
By providing the authentication details and the TLS configuration via references to `Secret` keys, this example will store the backups in a local Minio instance.

#### Scheduling

To minimize the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and mitigate the risk of data loss, it is recommended to perform backups regularly. You can do so by providing a `spec.schedule` in your `Backup` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup-scheduled
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
  schedule:
    cron: "*/1 * * * *"
    suspend: false
```

This resource gets reconciled into a `CronJob` that periodically takes the backups.

It is important to note that regularly scheduled `Backups` complement very well the [target recovery time](#target-recovery-time) feature detailed below.

#### Retention policy

Given that the backups can consume a substantial amount of storage, it is crucial to define your retention policy by providing the `spec.maxRetention` field in your `Backup` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup-scheduled
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
  maxRetention: 720h # 30 days
```

By default, it will be set to `720h` (30 days), indicating that backups older than 30 days will be automatically deleted.

## `Restore` CR

You can easily restore a `Backup` in your `MariaDB` instance by creating the following resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
```

This will trigger a `Job` that will mount the same storage as the `Backup` and apply the dump to your `MariaDB` database.

Nevertheless, the `Restore` resource doesn't necessarily need to specify a `spec.backupRef`, you can point to other storage source that contains backup files, for example a S3 bucket:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  s3:
    bucket: backups
    prefix: mariadb
    endpoint: minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000
    region:  us-east-1
    accessKeyIdSecretKeyRef:
      name: minio
      key: access-key-id
    secretAccessKeySecretKeyRef:
      name: minio
      key: secret-access-key
    tls:
      enabled: true
      caSecretKeyRef:
        name: minio-ca
        key: ca.crt
```

#### Target recovery time

If you have multiple backups available, specially after configuring a [scheduled Backup](#scheduling), the operator is able to infer which backup to restore based on the `spec.targetRecoveryTime` field.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
  targetRecoveryTime: 2023-12-19T09:00:00Z
```

The operator will look for the closest backup available and utilize it to restore your `MariaDB` instance.

By default, `spec.targetRecoveryTime` will be set to the current time, which means that the latest available backup will be used.

## Bootstrap new `MariaDB` instances

To minimize your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and to switfly spin up new clusters from existing `Backups`, you can provide a `Restore` source directly in the `MariaDB` object via the `spec.bootstrapFrom` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb-from-backup
spec:
  volumeClaimTemplate:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
  bootstrapFrom:
    backupRef:
      name: backup
    targetRecoveryTime: 2023-12-19T09:00:00Z
```

As in the `Restore` resource, you don't strictly need to specify a reference to a `Backup`, you can provide other storage types that contain backup files:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb-from-backup
spec:
  volumeClaimTemplate:
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 1Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
  bootstrapFrom:
    s3:
      bucket: backups
      prefix: mariadb
      endpoint: minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000
      accessKeyIdSecretKeyRef:
        name: minio
        key: access-key-id
      secretAccessKeySecretKeyRef:
        name: minio
        key: secret-access-key
      tls:
        enabled: true
        caSecretKeyRef:
          name: minio-ca
          key: ca.crt
    targetRecoveryTime: 2023-12-19T09:00:00Z
```

Under the hood, the operator creates a `Restore` object just after the `MariaDB` resource becomes ready. The advantage of using `spec.bootstrapFrom` over a standalone `Restore` is that the `MariaDB` is bootstrap-aware and this will allow the operator to hold primary switchover/failover operations until the restoration is finished.

## Backup and restore specific databases

By default, all the logical databases are backed up when a `Backup` is created, but you may also select specific databases by providing the `databases` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  databases:
    - db1
    - db2
    - db3
```

When it comes to restore, all the databases available in the backup will be restored, but you may also choose a single database to be restored via the  `database` field available in the `Restore` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
  databases: db1
```

There are a couple of points to consider here:
- The referred database (`db1` in the example) must previously exist for the `Restore` to succeed.
- The `mariadb` CLI invoked by the operator under the hood only supports selecting a single database to restore via the [`--one-database`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-command-line-client/#-o-one-database) option, restoration of multiple specific databases is not supported.

## Extra options

Not all the flags supported by `mariadb-dump` and `mariadb` have their counterpart field in the `Backup` and `Restore` CRs respectively, but you may pass extra options by using the `args` field. For example, setting the `--verbose` flag can be helpful to track the progress of backup and restore operations:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  args:
    - --verbose
```
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Restore
metadata:
  name: restore
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  backupRef:
    name: backup
  args:
    - --verbose
```

Refer to the `mariadb-dump` and `mariadb` CLI options in the [reference](#reference) section.

## Galera backup limitations

#### `mysql.global_priv`

Galera only replicates the tables with InnoDB engine:
- https://galeracluster.com/library/kb/user-changes.html

Something that does not include `mysql.global_priv`: the table used to store users and grants. This basically means that a Galera instance with `mysql.global_priv` populated will not replicate this data to an empty Galera instance. This is something to take into account when defining your backup strategy.

By default, the SQL dumps generated by the `Backup` resource include `DROP TABLE` statements to make the backup process idempotent. When they are restored in a `MariaDB` with Galera enabled, the `DROP TABLE` is propagated to the replicas, but not its data, resulting in authentication errors in the replicas. This is specially critical because the `livenessProbes` will fail with authentication errors, resulting in `Pods` restarting. More information can be found in https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/issues/556.

To overcome this, the operator automatically adds the `--ignore-table` option to ignore the `mysql.global_priv` when backing up a `MariaDB` with Galera enabled. This implies that `mysql.global_priv` will be skipped in backups and its recreation will rely in either:
- MariaDB image entrypoint, by using the `spec.rootPasswordSecretKeyRef`, `spec.username` and `spec.passwordSecretKeyRef` fields of the `MariaDB` CR.
- The `User` and `Grant` CRs, which will be eventually reconciled by the operator.

In any case, you are able to opt-out from this feature by setting the `spec.ignoreGlobalPriv=false` in the `Backup` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb
  ignoreGlobalPriv: false
```

#### `LOCK TABLES` 

Galera is not compatible with the `LOCK TABLES` statement:
- https://mariadb.com/kb/en/lock-tables/#limitations

For this reason, the operator automatically adds the `--skip-add-locks` option to the `Backup` to overcome this limitation.

## Migrating to a `MariaDB` with different topology

Logical backups serve not just as a source of restoration, but also enable data mobility between `MariaDB` instances. These backups are called "logical" because they are independent from the `MariaDB` topology, as they only contain DDLs and `INSERT` statements to populate data.

Although backing up and restoring data from `MariaDBs` with different topologies is possible, there are a couple of technical details that you need to be aware of in the following scenarios:

#### Migrating between standalone and replicated `MariaDBs`

This should be fully compatible, no issues have been detected.

#### Migrating from standalone/replicated to Galera `MariaDBs`

There are a couple of limitations regarding the backups in Galera, please make sure you read the [Galera backup limitations](#galera-backup-limitations) section before proceeding.

To overcome this limitations, the `Backup` in the standalone/replicated instance needs to be taken with `spec.ignoreGlobalPriv=true`. In the following example, we are backing up a standalone `MariaDB` (single instance):

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: backup-standalone
spec:
  mariaDbRef:
    name: mariadb-standalone
  ignoreGlobalPriv: true
```

Once the previous `Backup` is completed, we will be able bootstrap a new Galera instance from it:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb-galera
spec:
  galera:
    enabled: true
  bootstrapFrom:
    backupRef:
      name: backup-standalone
``` 

## Minio reference installation

The easiest way to get a S3 compatible storage is [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio). You can install it by using their [helm chart](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/helm/minio), or, if you are looking for a production-grade deployment, take a look at their [operator](https://github.com/minio/operator).

In our case, we have have [configured](../hack/config/minio.yaml) a Minio instance for [development](./DEVELOPMENT.md) purposes, you can easily install it by running:

```bash
make cluster
make install-minio
make net # to access the console via a MetalLB LoadBalancer: https://minio-console:9001
```
As an alternative, you can also use [play.min.io](https://play.min.io/) using these [credentials](../examples/manifests/config/minio-secret.yaml).
