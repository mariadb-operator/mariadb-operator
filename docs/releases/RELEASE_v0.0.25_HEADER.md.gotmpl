龙年快乐🐲! (Happy Year of the Dragon🐲!)

🚀 In the very first release of the year we are excited to announce that we are introducing support for ✨**MaxScale**✨: a sophisticated database proxy, router, and load balancer designed specifically for and by MariaDB. It provides a range of features that ensure optimal high availability:
  - Query-based routing: Transparently route write queries to the primary nodes and read queries to the replica nodes.
  - Connection-based routing: Load balance connections between multiple servers.
  - Automatic primary failover based on MariaDB internals.
  - Replay pending transactions when a server goes down.
  - Support for Galera and Replication.

Please take a look at the [MaxScale docs](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/main/docs/maxscale.md) for getting started with it.

💨 We have also introduced support for provisioning MariaDBs with empty root password and ephemeral storage, take a look at [this example](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/cdf83d7a7b7c05de63943f6242dd8fdb55f8dced/examples/manifests/mariadb_v1alpha1_mariadb_minimal.yaml). This has multiple use cases, such as provisioning MariaDB instances for your CI tests without hassle. Kudos to our new contributor @Hoega for stepping in and contributing with multiple PRs! 🙇

🪣 Support for prefixes in the S3 storage by @addreas, another new contributor! 🙇
