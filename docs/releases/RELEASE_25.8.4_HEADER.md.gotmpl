**`{{ .ProjectName }}` [25.08.4](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/releases/tag/25.8.4) is here!** ü¶≠

[25.08.4](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/releases/tag/25.8.4) is a patch release limited in scope and focusing on
bug fixes and optimizations, mostly related to `VolumeSnapshots`. Additionally, we have introduced support for managing resources in external MariaDBs, via the new `ExternalMariaDB` resource.

### `VolumeSnapshots` locking optimization

When performing a `VolumeSnapshot`, the operator now locks until the snapshot is created by the storage system, rather than waiting for the data to be fully replicated. See [#1420](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/issues/1420).

### `ExternalMariaDB` support

This release introduces support for managing resources in external MariaDB instances through the new `ExternalMariaDB` CR. This feature allows to manage users, privileges, databases, run SQL jobs declaratively and taking backups using the same CRs that you use to manage internal MariaDB instances.

For doing so, the first step is defining an `ExternalMariaDB`, which contains the connection details to the external database:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: ExternalMariaDB
metadata:
  name: external-mariadb
spec:
  host: mariadb.example.com
  port: 3306
  username: root
  passwordSecretKeyRef:
    name: mariadb
    key: password
  tls:
    enabled: true
    clientCertSecretRef:
      name: client-cert-secret
    serverCASecretRef:
      name: ca-cert-secret
  connection:
    secretName: external-mariadb
    healthCheck:
      interval: 5s
      retryInterval: 10s
```

Once defined, you can reference the `ExternalMariaDB` in other resources, such as `User`, `Database`, `Grant`, `SqlJob` and `Backup` just like you would do with an internal `MariaDB` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: user-external
spec:
  name: user
  mariaDbRef:
    name: external-mariadb
    kind: ExternalMariaDB
  passwordSecretKeyRef:
    name: mariadb
    key: password
  maxUserConnections: 20
  host: "%"
  cleanupPolicy: Delete
  requeueInterval: 10h
  retryInterval: 30s
```
