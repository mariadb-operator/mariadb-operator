Thank you for using `{{ .ProjectName }}`🦭!

📣 Amazing news: The project just got a major boost – it's now officially **sponsored by [MariaDB Corporation](https://mariadb.com/)** 🎉 I'm absolutely thrilled about this collaboration and can't wait to dive in and work with them!

🪣 More good news, but this time, something you've been waiting for a long time: ✨**S3 storage for backups**✨ is now officially supported, you can now store your backups in an S3 compatible storage like [AWS S3 ](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio). Refer to the documentation to see how to configure it:
- [Backup and Restore](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/main/docs/logical_backup.md)

📈 We have also introduced significant improvements on the metrics side, the newest version of [mysqld-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) has now been supported. This update facilitates the use of a single Deployment targeting all replicas, eliminating the need for a sidecar exporter per replica. For more details on this architectural modification, please refer to the documentation:
- [Prometheus metrics](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/main/docs/metrics.md)

🛠️ In order to achieve this, we have been polishing our CRDs considerably and introduced some **BREAKING CHANGES**. Check out our migration guide before upgrading:
