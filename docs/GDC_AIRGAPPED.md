[GDC air-gapped](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/overview) is a version of Google Cloudâ€™s Kubernetes-based private cloud targeted at deployments without public internet access.
It enables you to manage infrastructure, services, APIs, and tooling without a connection to Google Cloud or the public internet. 
GDC air-gapped provides compliance with strict data residency and security requirements for public sector organizations and regulated enterprises.

For applications built on GDC Air-Gapped that want to use MariaDB Enterprise Operator with MariaDB Enterprise Server, installation of MariaDB Operator is accomplished via GDC's built-in, click-to-deploy [application marketplace](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/hosted/docs/latest/gdch/application/ao-user/marketplace-overview), allowing you to manage MariaDB Enterprise Server and MaxScale instances in an air-gapped environment.

Support for [GDC connected](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs) by MariaDB Enterprise Operator, for MariaDB Enterprise Server customers, is in work in process.
