## Update strategies

In order to provide you with flexibility for updating `MariaDB` reliably, this operator supports multiple update strategies:

- [`ReplicasFirstPrimaryLast`](#replicasfirstprimarylast): Roll out replica `Pods` one by one, wait for each of them to become ready, and then proceed with the primary `Pod`.
- [`RollingUpdate`](#rollingupdate): Utilize the rolling update strategy from Kubernetes. 
- [`OnDelete`](#ondelete): Updates are performed manually by deleting `Pods`.

## Configuration

The update strategy can be configured in the `updateStrategy` field of the `MariaDB` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb
spec:
  ...
  updateStrategy:
    type: ReplicasFirstPrimaryLast
``` 

It defaults to `ReplicasFirstPrimaryLast` if not provided.

## Trigger updates

Updates are not limited to updating the `image` field in the `MariaDB` resource, an update will be triggered whenever any field of the `Pod` template is changed. This translates into making changes to `MariaDB` fields that map directly or indirectly to the `Pod` template, for instance, the CPU and memory resources:

```diff
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb
spec:
  ...
- image: mariadb:10.11.7
+ image: mariadb:10.11.8
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 128Mi
    limits:
-     memory: 1Gi
+     memory: 2Gi
```

Once the update is triggered, the operator manages it differently based on the selected update strategy.

## `ReplicasFirstPrimaryLast`

This role-aware update strategy consists in rolling out the replica `Pods` one by one first, waiting for each of them become ready (i.e. readiness probe passed), and then proceed with the primary `Pod`. This is the default update strategy, as it can potentially meet various reliability requirements and minimize the risks associated with updates:

- Write operations won't be affected until all the replica `Pods` have been rolled out. If something goes wrong in the update, such as an update to an incompatible MariaDB version, this is detected early when the replicas are being rolled out and the update operation will be paused at that point.
- Read operations impact is minimized by only rolling one replica `Pod` at a time.
- Waiting for every `Pod` to be synced minimizes the impact in the clustering protocols and the network.

## `RollingUpdate`

This strategy leverages the rolling update strategy from the [`StatefulSet` resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#rolling-updates), which, unlike [`ReplicasFirstPrimaryLast`](#replicasfirstprimarylast), does not take into account the role of the `Pods`(primary or replica). Instead, it rolls out the `Pods` one by one, from the highest to the lowest `StatefulSet` index.

You are able to pass extra parameters to this strategy via the `rollingUpdate` object:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.mariadb.com/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb
spec:
  ...
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 1
``` 

## `OnDelete`

This strategy aims to provide a method to update `MariaDB` resources manually by allowing users to restart the `Pods` individually.This way, the user has full control over the update process and can decide which `Pods` are rolled out at any given time.

Whenever an [update is triggered](#trigger-updates), the `MariaDB` will be marked as pending to update:

```bash
kubectl get mariadbs
NAME             READY   STATUS           PRIMARY POD        AGE
mariadb-galera   True    Pending update   mariadb-galera-0   5m17s
```

From this point, you are able to delete the `Pods` to trigger the update, which will result the `MariaDB` marked as updating:

```bash
kubectl get mariadbs
NAME             READY   STATUS     PRIMARY POD        AGE
mariadb-galera   False   Updating   mariadb-galera-0   9m50s
``` 

Once all the `Pods` have been rolled out, the `MariaDB` resource will be back to a ready state:

```bash
kubectl get mariadbs
NAME             READY   STATUS    PRIMARY POD        AGE
mariadb-galera   True    Running   mariadb-galera-1   12m
```
